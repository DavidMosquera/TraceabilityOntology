# TraceabilityOntology

### This repository provides additional material of the paper entitled “Ontology-based Automatic Reasoning for Supporting Trace Generation in Software Development”, submitted to the 34th International Conference on Advanced Information Systems Engineering (CAiSE'22), authored by D. Mosquera, M. Ruiz, O. Pastor, J. Spielberger, and L. Fievet.

# Repository Overview
TraceabilityOntology repository comprises all the files and source code for automatic reasoning based on context-dependent traceability ontologies. Such context-dependent traceability ontologies could be generated by using the guidelines provided in "Ontology-based Automatic Reasoning for Supporting Trace Generation in Software Development" paper. In this repository you have access to the following resources: 
* Traceability ontology OWL file, including the context-dependent traceability ontology OWL file of our running example at LogicFlow AG (```Traceability-Ontologies```)
* SPARQL queries in plain text (```SPARQL-Queries```)
* Prototype source code, containing the running example of LogicFlow AG (```LogicFlow-InnoCheck-v3```)

# Additional materials
Since our approach is being reviewed by the CAiSE2022 jurors, in this repository we will avoid directly including paper's textual information, avoiding self-plagiarism. However, we will refer to the section, tables, and guidelines proposed in the paper in the following sections by using the manuscript numbering-i.e., Guideline 1, Guideline 2, Section 4.5, Table 1, etc. For more details, please refer to the document directly.
