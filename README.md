# TraceabilityOntology

### This repository provides additional material of the paper entitled “Ontology-based Automatic Reasoning for Supporting Trace Generation in Software Development”, submitted to the 34th International Conference on Advanced Information Systems Engineering (CAiSE'22), authored by D. Mosquera, M. Ruiz, O. Pastor, J. Spielberger, and L. Fievet.

# Repository Overview
TraceabilityOntology repository comprises all the files and source code for automatic reasoning based on context-dependent traceability ontologies. Such context-dependent traceability ontologies could be generated by using the guidelines provided in "Ontology-based Automatic Reasoning for Supporting Trace Generation in Software Development" paper. In this repository you have access to the following resources: 
* Traceability ontology OWL file, including the context-dependent traceability ontology OWL file of our running example at LogicFlow AG (```Traceability-Ontologies```)
* SPARQL queries in plain text (```SPARQL-Queries```)
* Prototype source code, containing the running example of LogicFlow AG (```LogicFlow-InnoCheck-v3```)
