# TraceabilityOntology

### This repository provides additional material of the paper entitled “Ontology-based Automatic Reasoning for Supporting Trace Generation in Software Development”, submitted to the 34th International Conference on Advanced Information Systems Engineering (CAiSE'22), authored by D. Mosquera, M. Ruiz, O. Pastor, J. Spielberger, and L. Fievet.

# Repository Overview
TraceabilityOntology repository comprises all the files and source code for automatic reasoning based on context-dependent traceability ontologies. Such context-dependent traceability ontologies could be generated by using the guidelines provided in "Ontology-based Automatic Reasoning for Supporting Trace Generation in Software Development" paper. In this repository you have access to the following resources: 
* Traceability ontology OWL file, including the context-dependent traceability ontology OWL file of our running example at LogicFlow AG ([```Traceability-Ontologies```](https://github.com/DavidMosquera/TraceabilityOntology/tree/main/Traceability-Ontologies))
* SPARQL queries in plain text ([```SPARQL-Queries```](https://github.com/DavidMosquera/TraceabilityOntology/tree/main/SPARQL-Queries))
* Prototype source code, containing the running example of LogicFlow AG ([```LogicFlow-InnoCheck-v3```](https://github.com/DavidMosquera/TraceabilityOntology/tree/main/LogicFlow-InnoCheck-v3))

# Additional materials
Since our approach is being reviewed by the CAiSE2022 jurors, in this repository we will avoid directly including paper's textual information, avoiding self-plagiarism. However, we will refer to the section, tables, and guidelines proposed in the paper in the following sections by using the manuscript numbering-i.e., Guideline 1, Guideline 2, Section 4.5, Table 1, etc. For more details, please refer to the document directly.  

## Traceability matrix in Table 2
We exemplify a traceability matrix in Section 4.3 of the paper to implement Guideline 6. Due to space limitations, we only exemplify artifacts related to non-functional requirements. Therefore, we add to this repository the traceability matrix with some functional requirements associated with it as follows:

## Running example result from applying Guidelines 9 and 10
We exemplify with the running example at LogicFlow AG the properties related to traceability, instantiating what is mentioned in Sections 4.5 and 4.6 of the article (Guidelines 9 and 10). Due to space limitations, we do not include the graphical version of the example. Therefore, we include it in the repository as follows:

## Complete prototype example with source and target artifact
We show how the prototype looks like in the paper's Section 5. Due to space limitations, we just show the source artifact side of the automatic reasoning, excluding the target artifact side. Therefore, we include the full imagen in the repository as follows:
