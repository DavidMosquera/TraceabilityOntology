# Proposed ontologies
In this section you will find the traceability ontology ([TraceabilityOntology.owl](https://github.com/DavidMosquera/TraceabilityOntology/blob/main/Traceability-Ontologies/TraceabilityOntology.owl)) and the context-dependent traceability ontology ([TraceabilityOntology.owl](https://github.com/DavidMosquera/TraceabilityOntology/blob/main/Traceability-Ontologies/TraceabilityOntology.owl)) of the running example at LogicFlow AG. 

Both files have as URL ```<http://www.semanticweb.org/mosq/ontologies/2021/10/traceOntology1>```, we recommend using it under the prefix: ```PREFIX ontotrace: <http://www.semanticweb.org/mosq/ontologies/2021/10/traceOntology1#>``` to avoid inconsistencies with SPARQL queries.
