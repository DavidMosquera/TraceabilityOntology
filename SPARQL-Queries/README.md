# SPARQL Queries
In this subfolder you can find the SPARQL queries that we implemented in the article to retrieve the information from the automatic reasoner. Each of these queries seeks to answer one of the questions proposed in the paper. We relate them as follows: 
* What are the traces between my artifacts? -> go to [```WhatAreTheTracesBetweenMyArtifacts.txt```](https://github.com/DavidMosquera/TraceabilityOntology/blob/main/SPARQL-Queries/WhatAreTheTracesBetweenMyArtifacts.txt) file.
* Is there any untraced source/target artifact? -> go to [```isThereAnyUntracedSourceArtifact.txt```](https://github.com/DavidMosquera/TraceabilityOntology/blob/main/SPARQL-Queries/isThereAnyUntracedSourceArtifact.txt) and [```isThereAnyUntracedTargetArtifact.txt```](https://github.com/DavidMosquera/TraceabilityOntology/blob/main/SPARQL-Queries/isThereAnyUntracedTargetArtifact.txt) files.
* Given a specific source/target artifact, which are the suggested source/target artifacts that may be trace to it? -> go to [```WhatAreThePossibleTraceableSourcesGivenATargetArtifact.txt```](https://github.com/DavidMosquera/TraceabilityOntology/blob/main/SPARQL-Queries/WhatAreThePossibleTraceableSourcesGivenATargetArtifact.txt) and [```WhatAreThePossibleTraceableTargetsGivenASourceArtifact.txt```](https://github.com/DavidMosquera/TraceabilityOntology/blob/main/SPARQL-Queries/WhatAreThePossibleTraceableTargetsGivenASourceArtifact.txt) files.
